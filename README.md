# 9gag Tweaks  

A few improvements to 9gag to make it more user-friendly.

- use JPG-Source for images so they can be saved or dragged out directly (replacing the otherwise used .WEBP that doesn't work anywhere yet.)
- Replace the UI on videos with the standard HTML5 UI, so videos can be paused, volume chosen and play position changed.
